# 🧙‍♂️ Sistema NEMO – Interactive RPG Platform Powered by C++

**Sistema NEMO** is an immersive and interactive tabletop RPG platform designed to combine **modern web development** with **C++ programming via WebAssembly**. This project is built to help users enjoy RPG gameplay while also serving as a training ground for C++ logic embedded into a real application.

## 🔮 Main Features

- 🎲 **3D Dice Roll Animation Powered by C++ (WebAssembly)**  
  A fully interactive 3D dice roll using Three.js. The random result is calculated using a C++ algorithm compiled into WebAssembly for maximum performance and realism.

- 🧠 **RPG System: Characters, Rules, and Equipment**  
  Navigate through individual pages to manage your RPG system rules, characters, and gear—each section modular and visually polished.

- 🗺️ **Interactive Tactical Map with 1m² Grid**  
  Upload and display terrain maps divided into a 1m² grid to simulate tactical movement and combat positioning in your campaigns.

- 🐱 **Animated Companion**  
  The character *Cutie Katie* reacts visually when you roll the dice, adding personality and charm to the interface.

- 📷 **Custom Image Uploads**  
  Easily upload custom terrain images to use as battle maps in your campaign.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, [Three.js](https://threejs.org)  
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)  
- **Logic Layer**: C++ compiled with Emscripten to WebAssembly  
- **Visuals**: Responsive and fully customizable layout for tabletop environments

## 💡 Project Goals

Sistema NEMO was born from the desire to make **C++ learning visual and hands-on**. Instead of building traditional console applications, this project lets you implement and test real C++ logic (randomizers, movement validators, combat resolution, etc.) in a real RPG interface.
